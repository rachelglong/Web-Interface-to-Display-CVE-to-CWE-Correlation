# Web Interface to Display CVE to CWE Correlation

A cyber security based web application where the goal was to map CVE's to CWE's using machine learning and display the results on a web interface. This process took the textual description from MITRE of each CVE and CWE and used Natural Language Processing to find similarities between them using V2W-BERT. These similarities are displayed and categorized using a Self Organizing Map (SOM).
 
The web app was created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS along with the frameworks React and Bootstrap. 

The data shown in the CVE list table is populated by using Docker to connect and create a MongoDB instance which retrieves the JSON data for the client application using the fetch API and displays it in a table.

## Running the code

For the web app: 
- npm start

To populate the CVE List:
**Must be running a MongoDB instance inside a Docker container.**
- cd src
- node ./server.js

## Project status

This project was part of a Washington State University capstone project and is still on going with the university.
